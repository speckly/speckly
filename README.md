### The average computer nerd willing to learn new things. 
My goals are to work in a job in cyber security, and make some breakthrough in the IT world.
I would like to help people understand programming in my free time too since it really satisfies me
I dislike being left out in a discussion because I dont understand it so I will always take effort to learn a lot of things.

### Current education: Singapore Polytechnic, Diploma in Infocomm Security Management
